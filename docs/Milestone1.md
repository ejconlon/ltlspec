# Milestone 1

## Deliverables
* Theory language (syntax)
  * We will offer a short description (a few paragraphs) of the constructs we support in the Theory, and we will suggest a plausible syntax for expressing them.
* Example domain (actor-based system)
  * Theory for the domain
    * We will define a Theory (in the above textual format) that contains some interesting propositions and axioms one might need to verify operation of an actor-based system.
  * Synthetic logs or interesting scenarios
    * We will document some interesting scenarios that one would encounter when trying to verify these propositions.
    * We will generate some synthetic logs that will demonstrate the occurrence of some of these scenarios. The code to generate these logs will be in our test suite, as the logs will serve as test input.
