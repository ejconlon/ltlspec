# Milestone 3
2021-11-29

## Deliverables

These were our deliverables from the proposal:

* Bridge for example domain
  * We will define a Bridge for our example domain (an implementation in Haskell of the interface we defined) that can perform quantification and evaluate user-defined atomic propositions.
* Working verifier driver
  * We will implement a small driver program in Haskell to feed logs (in memory) through the LTL verifier and report results.
* Results on running driver on example logs
  * We will evaluate the results of our verifier on the representative scenarios for which we generated logs. Again, this will be arranged as a suite of unit tests.
