\maketitle

For our project, we propose to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement an LTL verifier (ideally with some time/space improvements over the naive version)
  \item Build a state machine model of some distributed system (e.g. an actor system, a vector clock algorithm, a consensus algorithm)
  \item Express several interesting LTL properties about that system
  \item Explore the classifications of those properties and the practical consequences of those classes with respect to verifier operation
\end{itemize}
